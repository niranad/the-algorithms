## Algorithms in JavaScript, Python and Java

This repository contains basic implementations of abstract data structures and common algorithms based on sorting, searching, divide and conquer, tree traversals, dynamic programming etc., in JavaScript, Python and Java with their test cases. The implementations may not be suitable for use in production code. These implementations are intended for learning purposes only. You can use any of the implementations as you deem fit.

## Algorithms

An algorithm is a set of instructions written to a computer to solve a problem or accomplish a task. The algorithms implemented here are either a class or a function that takes an input and returns an output, except for abstract data structures implementations. Often, an algorithm makes use of a data structure to solve a problem as most problems are based on an understanding of common and advanced data structures.

## Abstract Data Structures

An Abstract Data Structure (ADT) is a combination of a data structure and its unique operations on the stored data. Some examples are LinkedLists, Stacks, Queues and Trees.

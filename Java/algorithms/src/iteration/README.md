## Iteration Algorithms
This Java package contains miscellanous iteration algorithms. An iterative algorithm is usually more 
efficient than its recursive counterpart because it uses less space and are often straightforward with
zero tendency for duplicate work. Recursion requires extra space for each stack frame resulting from 
method calls and often requires a careful examination of the code to eliminate duplicate work 
through the use of memoization, a technique to cache the result of each call for later retrieval.

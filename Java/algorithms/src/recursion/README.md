## Recursive Algorithms
This Java package contains miscellanous recursion problem solutions. Recursion, a technique of dynamic
programming, usually offers a very concise and maintainable algorithm to problems with complicated 
iterative solutions. Recursion occurs when a method calls itself. Each method call stack requires
some space for storing its variables before and during its evaluation, after which it is discarded 
and the program evaluates the next most recent call stack. Therefore this technique requires more 
space than the iterative approach.
